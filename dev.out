No `serverToken` provided to `defineLive`. This means that only published content will be fetched and respond to live events. You can silence this warning by setting `serverToken: false`.
No `browserToken` provided to `defineLive`. This means that live previewing drafts will only work when using the Presentation Tool in your Sanity Studio. To support live previewing drafts stand-alone, provide a `browserToken`. It is shared with the browser so it should only have Viewer rights or lower. You can silence this warning by setting `browserToken: false`.
